In order to run our R script, you will need to download the following libraries:
Library from CRAN   Version
pacman              0.5.1
formattable         0.2.0.1
outliers            0.14
caret               6.0.84

dplyr               1.0.2
data.table          1.13.0

You will also need to make sure that the 2 datasets we used to train the model are in your working directory - These can be found in the data.zip folder:
• Number-of-arrests.csv
• Unemployment-by-region.csv
Once you have these, the R script can be run by simply starting execution from the “main.R” file.
